- 👋 Hi, I’m Julian! (@GitHusbando)
- 👀 I’m interested in systemic sandbox games, bad movies (check out Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter), video game modding, and whatever random topic I've found recently (cults, historical cooking, etc.).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make video games, with a focus on programming and art.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on video games with interesting systems and in-game creative freedom.
